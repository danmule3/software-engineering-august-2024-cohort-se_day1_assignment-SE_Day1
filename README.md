Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It is important because, it enables the creation of software applications that power various aspects of modern life. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages such as C. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline. The advent of structured programming. The rise of agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-this is the gathering of user needs and system requirements.
Design-creating high-level and detailed designs of the software and user interface.
Implementation-writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing-conducting tests to ensure various functionality.
Deployment-releasing the software to users.
Maintenance-providing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile is an interactive and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager-oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debbuging and testing code, for example, Visual Studio Code and Eclipse. On the other hand, VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and cordinating work among team members, like, Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt are some of the challenges engineers face and this can be solved by communicating effectively, prioritization of tasks, agile methodoligies and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing-testing individual modules of softwares.
Integration Testing-testing interactions between different components.
System Testing-testing entire software as a whole.
Acceptance Testing-testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is crafting questions to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
For example asking AI "Tell me about cars" might give a general answer but asking AI "Tell me about the history and development of cars from 1960 to 2020" might give a clear answer and a focused response. It is effective to be precise and clear when giving instructions to AI to get responses as needed.
